**Context:** I am building a mobile novel reader application using Flutter. I need to integrate a PostgreSQL database as the backend data source.

**Resources:**
1.  **Schema:** The database structure is defined in the file `/assets/data_scheme.sql`. It includes tables for `users`, `author`, `book`, `chapter`, `tag`, `book_tag`, and `shelf`.
2.  **Configuration:** The PostgreSQL connection string is stored in a `.env` file located at the project root directory.

**Task:**
Please implement the database integration layer for my Flutter project based on the provided resources.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Dependencies:** Suggest the necessary packages to add to `pubspec.yaml` (e.g., `postgres`, `flutter_dotenv`, `uuid`).
2.  **Data Models:** Generate Dart data models (classes) for all tables defined in `data_scheme.sql`. 
    * Ensure proper type mapping (e.g., UUID to String, TIMESTAMPTZ to DateTime).
    * Include `fromJson` and `toJson` methods.
3.  **Database Service:** Create a singleton `DatabaseService` class that:
    * Loads the connection string from the `.env` file.
    * Establishes and manages the connection to the PostgreSQL database.
4.  **Repositories:** Create a basic repository pattern example for the `Book` and `Chapter` tables to demonstrate how to query data (e.g., `getBooks`, `getChapterContent`).

**Note:** Ensure the code handles asynchronous operations and potential connection errors gracefully.
