Act as a Senior Flutter Developer. I am building an offline novel reader app called "Thien Thu". I need to integrate **SQLite** using the `sqflite` package.

**Project Setup:**
1.  **File Location:** I have the database schema defined in a file named `data_scheme.sql` located in my /assets/ folder.
2.  **Architecture:** The app works offline but mimics a client-server architecture.

**Your Task:**
Please provide the Dart code for the following components:

**1. Data Models (Dart Classes):**
* Create data classes based on the SQL schema provided.
* Include `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods for database compatibility.

**2. Database Service (Singleton):**
* Create a `DatabaseService` class to handle the connection.
* **Crucial:** In the `onCreate` callback, write logic to **load the `data_scheme.sql` file from the app assets** (using `rootBundle`), split the queries (if necessary), and execute them to create the tables. Do not hardcode the CREATE statements in Dart.

**3. Data Seeding (Mocking Server Data):**
* Create a function `seedInitialData(Database db)` that runs only if the database is empty.
* Generate dummy data for: 1 User, 2 Authors, 3 Books (with mixed Status), and 5 Chapters per book.
* Use the `uuid` package to generate unique IDs for the primary keys.

**4. Repository Implementation:**
* Create a `BookRepository` class.
* Implement methods like `fetchFeaturedBooks()` and `getChapterContent(String bookId, double chapterIndex)`.
* The repository should abstract the direct DB calls, making the UI feel like it's calling an API.
